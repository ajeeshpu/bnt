              <h2>Visiting party</h2>
              <p class="lead">Bharath's dad and mom, KP, Poornima, Hidilu, Suni, Sayi, Mythri, Paral Babu (Social activist), retd professor from Brennon college, his friend.</p>

              <h2>What was given</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>Rice - 5 kg each</li>
                  <li>Green grams</li>
                  <li>Tea powder</li>
                  <li>Cooking oil</li>
                  <li>Soap - 1 each</li>
                  <li>Coconut - 1 each</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>As it happened</h2>
              <p>Bharathan's dad had ordered rice and rest of the provisions from supply-co and asked them to make 40 bundles. On 6th Sept (Thursday), there was a hartal in Kannur. Due to that, a part of the packaging was not completed. Bharathan's parents and two of their friends completed the packing by themselves on 07th Sept.</p>

              <p>We (KP, Poornima, Hidilu, Sayi, and Mythri) arrived from Bangalore on 08th Sept early morning. We had breakfast at Bharthan's place. Another friend of Bharathan's dad came to meet us. We talked for a while about the activities and other stuff. Around 9, 3 others joined us and we left for Iritty in a tempo traveller. We picked up Suni at Iritty and drove uphill to the colony.</p>

              <p>Situation as it looked at the colony was quite bad in shape. Rows of houses, all in bad condition. Many of them, including children, were rushing out to see the visitors. All of them are mal-nutritioned and they were quite happy to see the us, expectation of a good meal could be clearly seen on their faces. We met the teacher (Lissy) at the anganvadi in the colony. She and Paral babu explained to us about the situation there.</p>

              <p>4 lacs/house was sanctioned by the goverment for building the house. The houses, seems like, were completed with around 20-30K Rs. Rest would have gone into pockets of politicians or bureaucrats. They had struggled get proper water supply to that location. No wells are possible, as it is on top of the hill. Only recently water pipeline was laid. There is no electricity at that place. Each family is allotted, on paper, 85 cents of land for cultivation use. But these people are not able to cultivate anything because the land is not yet partitioned. This makes it impossible for them to use the land, as there were too many disputes among the families. Moreover, they are not given seeds or other stuff required for cultivating crops. People in the town misuse them, give them very little money for daily wage jobs. The teacher told us that some weeks back, event small kids in all those families were starving as there were no work for the elders. Situation at the colony was pathetic.</p>

              <p>Some of the elder kids are studying in the nearby school (11 km from the colony), but sometimes they cant go to school because even the bus fare of 1 Rs was not affordable. </p>

              <p>After we reached there, we distributed laddus to all the kids around. The teacher had made a list of all families and then Bharathan's dad distributed rice and provisions to each family. 4 remaining package of provisions were kept in the nursery school for future use. None of the kids had proper clothes. Government had given low quality clothing material to them, but no money to stitch them. We  gave the teacher a sum of 2000 Rs to get the clothes stitched for 20 of the kids.</p>
