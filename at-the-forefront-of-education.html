    <h2>At the forefront of education</h2>
    <p class="lead">In 2013, BNT decided to focus on supporting excellent students to get quality education. Till date, we have supported over 28 kids from socioeconomically disadvantaged segments in the society. We expanded our operation to 3 districts in Kerala (Kannur, Kozhikode, and Thrissur).</p>
    <p class="lead">Most of the kids we support live under the poverty line (BPL – Below Poverty Line). Some of the inspiring stories we have come across should be told. The experience of interacting with those kids and seeing their passion to get good education solidifies our mission to support more and more such kids.</p>
    <p class="lead">One of the students we support has A+ in all the subjects in 10th standard. His father is a day laborer, earns just enough to feed his family. The kid has such a vibrant and confident attitude that we were in awe of the kid from the start. He knew that he wanted to study mechanical engineering and work for the Navy! At such a young age, such a focus you cant see in many. We supported him to join an excellent entrance coaching center in Kozhikode. He is one of the best students at that institute now. He has also taken up the initiative to give tuition to some of the low-performing students at his school. Such an initiative, even when his own future is not sealed, shows the humane content in a person. We are particularly proud of this brilliant chap. Interacting with him has made us self-inquire if we ourselves have utilized our intellectual capacities to the extent this young kid has done.</p>
    <p class="lead">Another student whom we supported in 2012 is suffering from “Hereditary sensory motor neuropathy”. It is a genetic disorder affecting the peripheral nerves. The nerves to the limbs -legs and hands are damaged, slowly but progressively. When years go by she may not be able to walk. Her dreams brighten her life. Confident, smart and creative, she simply knows that there is nothing which will stop her from realizing her dreams. She studied well and got admission to one of the best colleges for Bachelor of Science in Payyannur. Her dream is to start working as soon as possible to support her family. Take that! Someone who knows her own life might end up in a wheelchair wants to support her family! We were humbled by that 18 year old kid and her dream. Salute!</p>
    <p class="lead">Each of the kids we support has their own story to tell. We started the organization to support kids who want to get quality education. Inspired by such stories, we are strengthening our own goals. When we read “The Alchemist”, we expect to get such life changing inspirations. Least did we know that we would find the inspiration from our own gardens. Thank you kids for showing us the way to change our lives, we are learning from you.</p>
