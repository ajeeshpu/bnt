        <p class="lead">We are mainly a bunch of people who passed out from Regional Engineering College Calicut in 2001. It takes lot of courage, hard work and determination to get into ones of the most revered Engineering Colleges such as REC and it takes even more courage and brave heart to throw everything into wind and enjoy your college days especially in REC. In every batch we will have some wayward guys but what happens if we have an unprecedented number of wayward guys in a single batch? Yes, it happened with us.</p>

        <h2>Who is Bharath?</h2>
        <p class="lead">If ever a question was floated across to those who had passed out from REC Calicut during 1998-2004 (7 batches), to describe Bharath in one word, an answer would be there in a flicker of a second without anyone brooding over it. Remember that we live in an age where people forget the name of the person who sat next to them and to be remembered even after so many years speaks the great volume of the impact he had made. He was honest to the core, and a confident person with great sense of humour. His positive attitude, commitment, and his amazing ability to inspire did change the lives of many reticents. In short, he had all the leadership qualities and at a time others just talked about what they want to do, he actually walked the talk.</p>
        <p class="lead">We all floated across the campus in different groups but he thought a bit differently. He made friendship with everyone be it a fellow classmate, batch mate, canteen boy or a security guard. Soon the desolate group began to feel themselves as petals and with his presence in the middle, we all realized the blossoming flower, the friendship, and everyone felt special. It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship where cast, creed, religion etc had no place. There was a feeling of oneness in everything we did from that point onwards.</p>
        <p class="lead">He who united us has departed. Soon the Flower withered and petals drifted away into oblivion. Even in this age of modern technology and social networks, it took us 10 years and once again his NAME to regroup with the sole purpose of giving back something to the society in our own humble way.</p>
        <p class="lead">Our sole intention is to help out the neglected people, bringing smile on their faces because each and every smile will remind us about HIM. We look forward to bring more smiles and more memories and rest be assured that we will not align ourselves to any politico-religious or any such fraternities because we have nothing to prove to anyone as it’s all about HIM and our Friendship.</p>
        <p class="lead">Privilege is too big a word to use but let us reiterate that it was really a Privilege to be his friend and it’s a Privilege to do something in his honour.</p>
